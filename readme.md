RBIF100 Weeks 7/8 - Final Project: Bioinformatics Data Analysis and Visualization
Name: Helena Balbat

Purpose:



Included Files:
final_analysis.py : Python3 script that includes steps 1-3 of the final assignment. Generates data.csv
data.csv : generated CSV file of data collected with a RESTful API request from NCBi. Includes information on variants of the Homo sapiens apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene
analysis_report.md : final summary report of data analysis. Includes two generated figures 


How to Run:
In remote class server, type the following:
cd /home/balbh/week7
python3 final_analysis.py

This will output general print statements and results of the performed analyses. The script will output necessary data to data.csv
